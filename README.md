# COS-20007_Object_Oriented_Programming
The overall aim of this unit is to learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Design, and apply these in the development of Object Oriented programs using a modern OO language.
### For week 1-11 weekly task, I continue to solve it in the same folder and do not make a new one. So if you only need, for example, the MyRectangle.cs file, then just copy the code instead of downloading the whole folder.
### For the SwinAdventure game, you're going to have to download the zip folder because the game is too big for Git to be uploaded all at once.
### For the game and drawing game to work, you have to have C# NUnit, SplashKit, C# Extension, and .NET Extension already downloaded on your laptop and Visual Code Studio app!
### **This course requires a lot of basic understanding of C#; therefore, my reports and codes are only reference resources! Don't copy the whole thing if you have 0 clue what it's about!*
### **For Swinburne people, your Unit Tutor will have a different weekly verification task than my tutor, so please only take the necessary code file and do not take the whole thing and submit it to your tutor!*
